1. Creating a routes folder, in order not to bloat the server.js. Also to be easily readable

2. In the models folder, in the recipes folder we first write a Schema in order to create the structure of our model, and what is required. Then we export the module, and in there we speciy the name of the mode. 

- The timestamps in the Schema will tell when each model was created and also if we update one. It will tell us when it was updated.

The schema also servers as a validator!!
